Try to remember Joe, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is <span lang=\"ja\">じょう</span>. He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Joe as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) <span lang=\"ja\">じょ</span>. Although Joe will develop as you go through all the <span lang=\"ja\">じょう</span> reading kanji, for now, just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude, who works for a local farmer.

In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a \"street-woman\" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless.
